# 🕵️‍♂️ SQL Murder Mystery — *Who Killed the CEO?*

### Solved Using Pure SQL | A Mini Forensic Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my **SQL Murder Mystery** project — a fictional data-investigation challenge where the CEO of *TechNova Inc.* is found murdered, and every clue is hidden inside the company’s databases.

This project was solved entirely using **SQL**, leveraging joins, CTEs, timestamps, logs, and investigative logic.
It is the final highlight of my **IDC 21-Days SQL Challenge** journey.

## 🧩 Project Overview

**Scenario:**
The CEO of *TechNova Inc.* is found dead in the HQ building.
Your role → **Lead Data Analyst** 🕵️‍♂️
Your mission → **Solve the case using SQL only.**

Using the available tables, I uncovered:

* Keycard swipes
* Call records between employees
* Alibis and time overlaps
* Suspicious access to restricted zones
* Timeline reconstruction
* Evidence correlations
* Motive indicators

Every clue came from the database — no assumptions, no external tools.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

### ✔️ SQL Techniques Used

* **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
* **INNER JOIN / LEFT JOIN**
* **Time-based filtering**
* **Subqueries & nested logic**
* **Aggregation & grouping**
* **Data validation logic**
* **Cross-table investigations**
* **Pattern analysis using SQL**

### ✔️ Analytical Thinking

* Timeline reconstruction
* Validating alibis vs data
* Detecting anomalies
* Eliminating suspects one by one
* Building a data-backed conclusion

---

## 🧠 Final Outcome

After correlating:

* movement logs
* restricted-zone entry
* suspicious call history
* overlapping timestamps
* missing alibis

➡️ I identified the **killer using SQL alone**.

In the narrative…
**Data Analyst Ankit Tripathi solves the case and is appointed the new CEO of TechNova Inc.**
Because when *data speaks*, the truth becomes undeniable.
